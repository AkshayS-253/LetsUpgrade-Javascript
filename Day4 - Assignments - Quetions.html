        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again. 
        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line. 
        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</h2>

    <h1>Assignment Que-7</h1>
    <h2>An integer number greater than 1 is called a ​prime​ if it cannot be divided without a remainder by 
        anything except 1 and itself. In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by 
        anything except 1 and n. For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder
        by 2, 3 and 4. Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n. For n = 10 the result 
        will be 2,3,5,7. P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value</h2>
